## Travel

- I am currently building my tiny home inside a retired news crew van.
- I have been to 26 countries so far! I've done 3 major bicycle tours (from Seattle to San Francisco, around Taiwan, and around New Zealand).
- I've hitchhiked over 10,000 miles.

## Talks and Interviews

- Talk for TA3M Seattle: "How  AI can be abused by surveillance states" ([presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfn3T7R-ufjbzfmlVSMgAIyjC6hYhTTC41LMleQNFcQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- Interview with KOMO news in Seattle over the net neutrality debate
- Interview with [Edventure Project](http://edventureproject.com): [Why we pick up hitchhikers](http://edventureproject.com/why-we-pick-up-hitchhikers/)

## Computing

- **Home server** - I am proud of my home server. I run the following services: wallabag, owncloud, bittorrent, ZeroNet, IPFS.
- **[Mobile library](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBox-Mesh)** - I converted a Raspberry Pi into an awesome mobile filesharing mesh network.

## Volunteering, Activism, Organizing

- I organized and led a protest against Congress's plans to end the Internet's decentralized nature. Downtown Seattle, December 2014.
- I spent a month and a half volunteering on Mota Lava, Vanuatu. I was helping communities be more resilient by teaching them to make virgin coconut oil and facilitating business deals. I gave various lectures at the local school and helped get paint for the local church.
