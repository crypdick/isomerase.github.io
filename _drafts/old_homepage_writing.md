Academics

My scientific interests are fairly eclectic and include: computational neuroscience, cell biology, theoretical physics, cosmology. I also devour social justice-related articles on the patriarchy, heteronormativity, ableism/racism/sexism/ageism and spend a lot of time thinking about how to subvert (or otherwise not participate in) systems of oppression.

I get lost in a jungle of Wikipedia tabs pretty often.

I have an honors degree in biochemistry and am co-author on a few peer-reviewed journal articles. At the moment, I'm switching tracks to computational neuroscience. I currently work as a NIH scientist at the University of Washington, where I make models that try to explain how mosquitos are capable of tracking turbulent plumes.

Travel

I decided to live a little before getting chained to the lab bench for 5+ years, so I did the sensible thing and bought a one-way ticket to China! I spent 3 years backpacking around Asia, SE Asia, the land down under,  the land down under-er, Vanuatu, before coming home. I had a blast and got to do a bunch of volunteering along the way.

Super Tramp

I've managed to do a fair amount of traveling: 23 countries and 25 U.S. states as of 4/2015.  How did I afford it? Lots of hitchhiking, couchsurfing, freedom camping, and peanuts!

Hitchhiking

I love hitchhiling. I thumbed 8,500 miles across Australia, every inch of New Zealand, around Thailand, and up and down the U.S. Pacific coast.

Bike Tours

I've done several cross-country cycle tours. Most recently, I rode 1,000 miles from Seattle to San Francisco, but before that I rode across New Zealand and Taiwan.

...and more to come!

I have big plans ahead!

Art

I love capturing the intricacies in landscapes, rock formations, and biology. I tend to prefer impressionist styles.

Galleries

I am mostly a landscape and macro photographer, although I am dabbling in light painting and astrophotography. A section of my works was recently acquired by the Sir James Wallace Arts Trust and is currently in circulation in public spaces around New Zealand.
